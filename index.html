Level 1 cache (L1) is a small, fast memory cache that is built into the microprocessor chip and helps speed up access to frequently used data; 2. Level 2 cache (L2) is a collection of fast, built-in memory chips situated between the microprocessor and main memory. Disk cache is a specialized buffer used to store data read from disk.</p>

Instead of writing data one bit at a time across all of the drives, RAID-4 writes data in strips of uniform size, creating a stripe across all of the drives as described in RAID-0. Bits in the data strip are XORed with each other to create the parity strip. RAID-4 is essentially RAID-0 with parity.</p>

    <p><b>SCAN
        </b></p>
    <br>
    <p> A disk-scheduling algorithm where the disk arm continually sweeps over the surface of the disk, stopping when it reaches a track for which it has a request in its service queue. This approach is called the elevator algorithm because of its similarity to how skyscraper elevators service their passengers. SCAN has a variant, called C-SCAN (for circular SCAN), in which track zero is treated as if it were adjacent to the highest-numbered track on the disk.</p>

    <p> An acronym for Small Computer System Interface, a disk drive connection technology that allows multiple devices to be daisy-chained and addressed individually through a single host adapter. Has been expanded to include numerous connection methods through the SCSI-3 Architecture Model (SAM), which is a layered system with protocols for communication between the layers. SAM incorporates Serial Storage Architecture (SSA), Serial Bus (also known as IEEE 1394 or FireWire), Fibre Channel, and Generic Packet Protocol (GPP) into a unified architectural model.</p>
